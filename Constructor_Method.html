<!--
    A JavaScript constructor method is a special type of method which 
    is used to initialize and create an object. It is called when memory
     is allocated for an object.

Points to remember
The constructor keyword is used to declare a constructor method.

The class can contain one constructor method only.

JavaScript allows us to use parent class constructor through super keyword.
-->

<script>
    class Student{

        constructor(rollno , name ){
                this.name = name ;
                this.rollno = rollno;
        }
        display(){
            document.write("rollNo :"+this.rollno+" ,   Name : "+this.name);
        }
    }

    var s1 = new Student(121,"Salma");
    s1.display();
</script>

<!--
    Constructor Method Example: super keyword
The super keyword is used to call the parent class constructor

Must call super constructor in derived class before
 accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor
-->
<script>
    class CompanyName{
        constructor(){
            this.company = "TCS"
        }
    }

    class Employee extends CompanyName{
        constructor(id,name){
            super();
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name;
        }

        details(){
            document.write("id : "+this.id + " ,  name: "+this.name+" , Company working : "+this.company);
        }
    }
    var emp1 = new Employee(1212121,"Sahithi Patel  <br>");
    
    document.write("<h3> i will make dynamic website with javascript </h3><br>");
    emp1.details();

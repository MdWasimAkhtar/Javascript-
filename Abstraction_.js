JavaScript Abstraction
An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and
 showing only the functionality to the users. In other words,
  it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

Points to remember
We cannot create an instance of Abstract Class.
It reduces the duplication of code.

Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects 
(to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. 
The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)

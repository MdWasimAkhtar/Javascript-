<!--
    Static keyword in JavaScript: The static keyword is used to define 
    a static method or property of a class. To call the static method we
    do not need to create an instance or object of the class.

Static variable in JavaScript: We used the static keyword to make a variable
 static just like the constant variable is defined using the const keyword.
  It is set at the run time and such type of variable works as a global variable.
   We can use the static variable anywhere. The value of the static variable can be reassigned,
    unlike the constant variable.

Why we create a static variable in JavaScript: We create a static variable
 in JavaScript to prevent replication, fixed-configuration, and it is also useful for caches.
 
JavaScript static Method
---------------------------

The JavaScript provides static methods that belong to the class instead of an instance of that class.
 So, an instance is not required to call the static method. These methods are called directly on the class itself.

Points to remember
The static keyword is used to declare a static method.

The static method can be of any name.

A class can contain more than one static method.

If we declare more than one static method with a similar name, the JavaScript always invokes the last one.

The static method can be used to create utility functions.

We can use this keyword to call a static method within another static method.

We cannot use this keyword directly to call a static method within the non-static method. In such case,
we can call the static method either using the class name or as the property of the constructor.

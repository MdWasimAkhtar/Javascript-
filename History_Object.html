The JavaScript history object represents an array of URLs visited 
by the user. By using this object, you can load previous, forward or any particular page.

The history object is the window property, so it can be accessed by:
-->
<script>
    alert(window.history.length);
    history.back(); 
    history.go(-3);

</script>

<!--
    In JavaScript, classes are the special type of functions. We can define the class
     just like function declarations and function expressions.

The JavaScript class contains various class members within a body including methods
 or constructor. The class is executed in strict mode. So,
 the code containing the silent error or mistake throws an error.
-->

<script>
    //Declaring Class
    class Employee{
        //initializing an Object
        constructor(id,name){
            this.id = id;
            this.name = name ;
        }
        //Declaring method
        details(){
            document.write("Name :"+this.name+" id : "+this.id+"<br>");
        }

        adding(a,b) {
            document.write(""+a+b);
        }
    }
    var e1 = new Employee(102,"Wasim");
    var e2 = new Employee(103,"Nagaratna");
    e1.details();
    e2.details();
    e1.adding(23+33);
</script>

<!--   *****
Class Declarations Example: Re-declaring Class
A class can be declared once only. If we try to declare 
class more than one time, it throws an error
-->

<!--
    Class expressions
Another way to define a class is by using a class expression. Here, 
it is not mandatory to assign the name of the class. So, the class expression 
can be named or unnamed. The class expression allows us to fetch the class name. 
However, this will not be possible with class declaration
-->

<script>
    var emp = class{
        constructor(id , name){
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id ;
        }
    };

    document.write(emp.name+"<br/>");

    var emp = class{
        constructor(id , name){
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id ;
        }
    };

    document.write(emp.name);
</script>

<!--Named class Expression example-->
<script>
    var emp2 = class Employee2{
        constructor(){

        }
    }
</script>
